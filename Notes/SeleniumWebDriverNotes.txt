Methods:
--------
1. void get(String URL); --> This method is used to load the Website
2. String getTitle(); --> This method is used to get the title of the webpage
3. navigate().to(String url)--> This method is used to load the URL
4. void close() --> This method is used to close the browser
5. void quit() --> This method is used to close browser

6. String getCurrentURL() --> This method is used to get the Current URL of the application
7. String getPageSource() --> This method is used to get the page source of the application
8. manage().window().maximize() --> This method is used to maximize the browser window
9. getWindowHandle() --> This method is used to get the the current window Session ID
10. getWindowHandles() --> This method is used to return the number of windows which are opened by WebDriver
11. switchTO() --> This method is used to used to switch between the browser windows
12. navigate().forward() --> This method is used to move forward in the current browser window
12. navigate().back() --> This method is used to move backward in the current browser window
13. findElement(By by) --> This method is used to find the Element of a page/application
14. findElements() --> This method is used to return the list of elements in a page/application

Difference between get() and navigate().to():
----------------------------------------------
==> Both get(String url) and navigate.to(String url) methods are used to load the given URL.
	When get() method is used, driver will wait till the complete page/application is loaded and then it moves to next step in the script
	When navigate().to() method is used, driver will not wait till the complete page/application is loaded. It just loads the url and moves to the next step in the script
	
Difference between close() and quit():
--------------------------------------
==>Both close() and quit() methods are used to close the browsers
	When close() method is used, driver will close the current window which is opened by WebDriver
	When quit() method is used, driver will close all the windows which are opened by WebDriver
