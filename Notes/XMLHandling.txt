Properties files, XML files, YAML files, Json files, text files, CSV files, Excel files etc.,

XML Handling:
-------------

XML --> Extensible Markup Language

==> Reading XML file is called parsing

XML Parsing

										XML Parsing
											|
							------------------------------------
							|									|
						Object Based						Event Based
						 (e.g DOM)								|
														---------------------
														|					|
													Push Parsing			Pull Parsing
														(e.g SAX)				(e.g. StAX)
														
==> Difference between DOM and SAX Parsers			
DOM Parsers											SAX Prasers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DOM Stands for Document Object Model				1. SAX stands for Simple API for XML
2. DOM reads the entire document					2. SAX reads node by node
3. DOM is useful when reading small to medium size	3. SAX is used when big XML files needs to 
XML files
4. DOM is tree based parser							4. SAX is event based parser
5. DOM is letter slow as compared to SAX			5. SAX is faster than DOM
6. DOM can insert and delete nodes					6. SAX cannot insert and delete node

==> From the Programmer, if the xml file data is to be read then developer has to write their own code to parse the xml file. It is complicated.
==> To avoid this, Java/programming language has given parsers like DOM and SAX to read the xml file
==> XML parser consumes lot of time and it is complicated, DOM/SAX parser is used to parse the xml file. using this code can be developed and accurate

To Create a XML File:
---------------------
1. In the program, document object is created
2. Elements/nodes of the XML file are created
3. Data to be placed in between the nodes are created in text object
4. Text and elements (nodes) are linked
5. Nodes are linked to the Root Node
6. Finally, Transformer transform() method is used to convert the document object to XML file

DOM Parser:
-----------
import javax.xml.prasers.*;
import org.w3c.dom.*;
import java.io.*;
import javax.xml.transform.*;
import javax.xml.transform.dom.*;
import javax.xml.transform.stream.*;

SAX Parser:
-----------
import javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser;
import javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory;
import org.xml.sax.*;
import org.xml.sax.helpers.*;
import java.io.*;
